                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>Grant Erickson built the Sawmill Calculator Pro app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Grant Erickson and is intended for use as is.</p>
          <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.</p>
          <p>If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Sawmill Calculator Pro unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
          <p>The Sawmill Calculator Pro application is designed as a stand-alone local application that does not communicate with external servers as a part of its core functionality. While not core functionality, one exception is for analytics data to diagnose errors and improve the application.</p>
          <p>Since I do not have 100% control of the entire application infrastructure including but not limited to the operating system, it is possible that data could be breached. However, due to the nature of the application, this would only be data related to the use of the application.</p>
          <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I may collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
